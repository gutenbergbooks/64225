<p class="ph1"><i>The Story of</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Tubbs</span></p>
</div>


<p>Once upon a time, many, many years ago,
there lived a very old woman and her name was
Mrs. Tubbs. She lived on a little farm, way off in
the country. Her little house stood on the edge of
the woods, not very far from a village with a little
church, and a little river with a little bridge over it,
flowed close by the house. There was a barn too
for cows and horses, only the woman hadn&#8217;t any
cows or horses; she lived all alone with a dog and
a duck and a pig. The dog&#8217;s name was Peter Punk,
the duck&#8217;s name was Polly Ponk, and the pig&#8217;s
name was Patrick Pink. The old woman called
them Punk, Ponk and Pink for short.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_009.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">Mrs. Tubbs&#8217;s Farm</p>


<p>Punk and Ponk had known one another for
many years and were very good friends. The pig
they treated as a baby because they said he was
very young and hadn&#8217;t much sense.</p>

<p>The old woman did not own the farm although
she had lived on it so long. The farm belonged to
a man up in London who never came there at all.
This man, one fine day at the end of summer when
the leaves were beginning to fall in the woods, sent
his nephew, a very silly young man with a red face,
down from London to live in the farm-house instead
of Mrs. Tubbs.</p>

<p>Punk, Ponk and Pink and the old woman were
all dreadfully sad at having to leave the home where
they had been so happy together for so many years.</p>

<p>As the sun was going down behind the little
church one evening at the end of Summer when the
leaves were beginning to fall in the woods, they all
left the farm together, Punk in front, then Pink,
then Ponk and Mrs. Tubbs behind.</p>

<p>They walked a long, long way along the edge of
the woods and at last when they saw a seat under a
tree they all sat down to rest.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_015.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">They all sat down to rest</p>


<p>&#8220;Oh dear, oh dear,&#8221; Mrs. Tubbs kept saying,
&#8220;now I have no home, no place to sleep. And me
an old woman. To be turned off the farm after
all these years! What shall I do, where shall I go?
Oh dear, oh dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she stopped talking. Peter Punk and Polly
Ponk both understood what she said because they
had lived with her so long. Pink couldn&#8217;t understand
because he was only a baby and he kept
saying in animal language:&mdash;&#8220;Let&#8217;s go on. I don&#8217;t
like this place. There&#8217;s nothing to eat here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do think it&#8217;s a shame,&#8221; Polly Ponk said to
Punk, &#8220;that the old woman should be turned out.
Did you see the way that stupid man slammed the
door after we had gone? I&#8217;d like to see him turn <i>me</i>
out of <i>my</i> house that way. I&#8217;d give him such a peck
on his red nose he wouldn&#8217;t try it again! But of
course she is old, very old. I often wonder how old
she really is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is over a hundred, I know,&#8221; said Punk. &#8220;Yes,
it is a shame she should have to go for that stupid
booby. &#8216;Beefsteak-and-Onions&#8217; I call him. But it
isn&#8217;t altogether his fault. He&#8217;s only sent here from
London by his uncle who owns the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what are we going to do with the old lady?&#8221;
asked Ponk. &#8220;She can&#8217;t stay here.&#8221;</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_021.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">They set Pink to digging truffles</p>



<p>&#8220;We will wait till she falls asleep,&#8221; said Punk.
&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll go into the woods and find a cave for
her to spend the night in and cook something to
eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she asleep now?&#8221; asked Ponk. &#8220;Her eyes
are shut.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the dog, &#8220;she&#8217;s crying. Can&#8217;t you
feel the seat shaking? She always shuts her eyes
and shakes when she cries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Presently the old lady and the pig began to snore
together. So they waked poor Pink up and all three
went into the woods. They set Pink digging truffles
and Polly Ponk went off to the river and caught a
fine trout while Punk got sticks together and made a
fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now who&#8217;s going to do the cooking?&#8221; asked Punk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; said Ponk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you cook?&#8221; asked the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I can,&#8221; said Polly Punk. &#8220;My Aunt
Deborah used to cook at a hotel and she showed me
how. You get the fire burning and I&#8217;ll soon have
the fish fried.&#8221;</p>

<p>So very soon they had a nice meal ready of fried
trout and truffles for the old lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Punk, &#8220;we must go into the cave
and get a bed ready for Mrs. Tubbs.&#8221;</p>



<p>So they went into the cave and made a fine, soft
bed of leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do for a pillow,&#8221; asked Punk. &#8220;Shall
we use the pig, he would be nice and soft?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Ponk, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to use him as a hot-water
bottle. It&#8217;s very important to keep the old
lady&#8217;s feet warm. But I have some feathers back
home which will make a fine pillow. They are some
of my own which I kept last moulting season.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you do that for?&#8221; asked Punk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said the duck, standing first on one foot
then on the other, &#8220;the fact is I&#8217;m not getting any
younger myself and I thought that if, when I am
very old, I should get bald, I could have them stuck
on with glue or something. I&#8217;ll fly over to the farm
and fetch them. I know just where I put them:
they&#8217;re in the left-hand drawer of my bureau under
my lavender bonnet.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a flap of her wings she flew over the tree-tops
to the farm and in a minute was back again
with the feathers in a bag.</p>

<p>When they had everything ready they went and
fetched Mrs. Tubbs and showed her the supper they
had prepared. But the old woman would not eat
anything but kept saying,</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, oh dear! What shall I do? I am turned
out of house and home, and me an old woman!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_031.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">She cried herself to sleep</p>

<p>So they put her to bed in the cave, covered her over
with leaves and placed Pink at her feet as a hot-water
bottle. And presently she cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p>Punk and Ponk now began to worry over what
they should do with the old woman next.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t stay here,&#8221; said Ponk. &#8220;That&#8217;s certain.
You see, Punk, she isn&#8217;t eating anything. She is so
upset and she is so old. What we&#8217;ve got to do is to
find some way to turn that booby out of the farm so
she can go back and live there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what shall we do?&#8221; said the dog.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t just know yet,&#8221; Polly Ponk answered.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_035.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap"><i>Tommy Squeak</i></span><br />

<i>The King of The Water-Rats.</i></p>



<p>&#8220;But in the morning before she wakes up, we must
go back to the farm and see what can be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>So next morning, while the old woman was still
asleep, off they all went as the sun was getting up
behind the woods. Just before they got to the farm
as they were crossing the bridge over the stream, they
saw Tommy Squeak, the King of the Water-rats coming
down for his morning bath in the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;Catch him!&#8221; said Ponk. &#8220;Perhaps he&#8217;ll be able
to help.&#8221; And they all started running as hard
as they could after the water-rat. Poor Tommy
Squeak was dreadfully frightened at seeing a dog
and a pig and a duck coming after him, and he made
off for the river as fast as his legs would carry him.
When he came to the river he jumped in with a
splash and disappeared. Punk and Pink sat down
on the grass and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve lost him!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_039.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">They all started running as hard as they could</p>



<p>But Polly Ponk, running up behind, never stopped
but dived into the river, swam under the water and
just caught poor Mr. Squeak as he was popping into
a hole way down at the bottom of the river. She
pulled him up by his tail, carried him to the shore
and put him on the grass. Then they all gathered
round him so he couldn&#8217;t run away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said the duck, &#8220;don&#8217;t be frightened. Stay
where you are and do as you are told and we won&#8217;t
hurt you. Listen. Do you remember, last summer,
when you were stealing cheese from the pantry
up at the farm, and you fell into a bucket of water
and Mrs. Tubbs came and caught you? Do you
remember?&#8221;</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_043.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>They all gathered round
so he couldn&#8217;t run away.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tommy Squeak, shaking the water
off his whiskers, still very frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she didn&#8217;t hurt you or give you to the cat.
Do you remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tommy Squeak.</p>

<p>&#8220;She let you go and told you never to come back
again. Did she not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tommy Squeak.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that she is the kindest woman to
animals in all the world, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Tommy Squeak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allright,&#8221; said Polly. &#8220;Now listen. A red-faced
booby from London Town has been sent down here
to turn Mrs. Tubbs out of her house. She is terribly
old, as you know; we have taken her up into the
woods. But she won&#8217;t eat her food, she is so sad,
and we can&#8217;t do a thing with her. The Winter is
coming on and we must get her back into the farm
somehow. Now you are the king of the water-rats
and this is what you must do: Call all the rats of
the river together&mdash;every one of them&mdash;thousands
of them, and take them to the farm. Then worry
the booby every way you can think of. Rattle the
pans in the kitchen at night so he can&#8217;t sleep. Pull
the stuffing out of the chairs. Eat holes in his best
hat. Do everything you can to drive him out. Then,
if he goes back to London Town, we can put Mrs.
Tubbs back on the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Allright,&#8221; said Tommy Squeak. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do my
best for the old woman. She certainly ought to be
put back on the farm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he stood up on his hind-legs by the river-bank
and facing up the stream, he gave a long, loud,
wonderful squeak. Then he turned and facing down
the stream he gave another.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_051.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Rats,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have a job of work to do&#8221;</p>

<p>And presently there was a rustling sound in the
grasses all around and a whispering sound in the
bushes and a splashing sound from the water. And
everywhere rats appeared, hopping and jumping towards
him&mdash;big ones and little ones, black ones, grey
ones, brown ones, piebald ones&mdash;families of them,
hundreds of them&mdash;thousands&mdash;millions. And they
gathered round Tommy Squeak the King-Rat in a
great, great big circle. Their beady, black eyes looked
very frightened when they saw a dog there but they
didn&#8217;t run away because the king had called them.</p>

<p>Then Tommy Squeak stood up to speak to them
and they all stopped cleaning their whiskers to listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rats,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have a job of work to do.
Follow me.&#8221; And waving his paw to Punk, Ponk
and Pink, he led the way to the farm.</p>

<p>For a whole day and a night the rats worked very
hard, trying to turn the man out. They rattled
the pans in the kitchen at night. They pulled the
stuffing out of his chair. They ate holes in his new,
green hat. They stopped the clock. They pulled
the curtains down upon the floor. But the man sent
to London Town and got three wagon-loads of cats
and the rats were all driven back to the river. Tommy
Squeak came to Punk, Pink and Ponk on the second
day and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry. We did our best, but we couldn&#8217;t
move him.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Tilly Twitter</i><br />

<i>The Queen of the Swallows</i></p>

<p>So Ponk said to Punk, &#8220;Well, we must try something
else.&#8221; And they left the old woman in the
woods and started off again.</p>

<p>As they were crossing the river this time before
they got to the farm, they saw Tilly Twitter, the
Queen of the Swallows, sitting on the corner of the
bridge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning!&#8221; said Tilly. &#8220;You all look very
sad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Tilly,&#8221; said Punk, with tears in his eyes,
&#8220;Mrs. Tubbs has been turned out of house and
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good gracious!&#8221; cried Tilly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t say!
Who turned her out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A man from London,&#8221; said Punk. &#8220;I call him
&#8216;Beefsteak-and-Onions.&#8217; Do you think you can do
anything to help us get her back to the farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I&#8217;ll do my best,&#8221; said Tilly, pushing
her crown further back on her head. &#8220;I have built
my nest over the old woman&#8217;s door for three Springs
now. I would hate to have her leave the farm for
good. I&#8217;ll see what I can do.&#8221;</p>


<p>Then she flew up into the air going round and round
in circles. Higher and higher she flew and all the
time she sang a beautiful song at the top of her voice.</p>

<p>And this is the song she sang:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;<i>The leaves are falling in the woods.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Go get your travelling rugs and hoods.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>The Summer&#8217;s gone; the snow&#8217;ll soon be here.</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>It&#8217;s time to fly; but we&#8217;ll come back next year.</i>&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>Now every year when all the swallows heard Tilly
Twitter sing this song they knew it was time for them
to get together to fly to Africa because they don&#8217;t
like the winter&#8217;s cold in England. So now when
they heard it they got their children together and
snatching up their bags and bundles, they all flew
towards Mrs. Tubbs&#8217;s farm. So many of them came
that the sky grew dark and people thought the night
was come. And the farm-boys in the country around
stopped their plough-horses and said, &#8220;There go the
swallows, getting ready to fly to Africa. The frost
will soon be here.&#8221;</p>

<p>For five hours they kept coming, more and more
and more of them. They gathered around Tilly,
sitting on house, on the barn and the railings, on the
gates, on the bridge and on the stones. But never
on the trees. Swallows never sit on trees. So many
of them came that the whole land seemed covered
with the blue of their wings and the white of their
breasts.</p>

<p>And when they had all arrived Tilly got up and
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Swallows,&#8221; she said, &#8220;many years ago, when I
first built my mud nest under the eaves of this farm,
I had five children in my nest. They were my first
family and I was very proud of them. That was
before I became the Queen of the Swallows. And
being a very inexperienced mother I built the nest
too small. When my children grew up there was
not proper room for them. Philip&mdash;a very strong
child&mdash;was always twisting and turning in the nest
and one day he fell out. He bumped his nose badly
on the ground but it was not far to fall and he was not
much hurt. I was just going to fly down and try
to pick him up when I saw a large weasel coming
across the farm-yard to get him. My feathers stood
up on the top of my head with fright. I flew to the
farm-house window and beat upon the glass with my
wings. An old woman came out. When she saw
Philip on the ground and the weasel coming to get
him she threw her porridge-spoon at the weasel,
picked Philip up and put him back in my nest.
That old woman&#8217;s name was Mrs. Tubbs. She has
now been turned out of her house and a very stupid
red-faced man is living on the farm in her place.
We have got to do our best to turn him out and put
Mrs. Tubbs back in her house, the same as she put
my child back in his nest. So I have called you all
together a week earlier than usual this year for our
long journey to Africa, and before we leave England
we have got to see what we can do. The first thing
we&#8217;ll do is to stop up his chimney so his fire won&#8217;t
burn. Then put mud all over the windows so the
light will not come in. Bring all the straw from
the barn and fill his bed-room with it. Take his
best neck-tie and drop it in the river. And do everything
you can to drive him out.&#8221;</p>



<p>So the swallows set to work and Punk, Ponk and
Pink went back to the old woman in the woods.</p>

<p>But after two days Tilly came to them and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sorry, but I have not succeeded. The
cats have driven my swallows away. He has a thousand
cats in the place. What can one do?&#8221;</p>

<p>So Punk said to Ponk, &#8220;We must go out and try
something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Polly Ponk answered,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you go alone this time. The old woman is
getting a cold and I must stay and look after her.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Peter Punk went off with his tail dragging on
the ground. He hung about the farm and was very
sad and wondered what he could do to drive Beefsteak-and-Onions
out of the house.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_075.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">He looked into the hole</p>

<p>Presently, feeling hungry, he remembered he had
hidden a ham-bone in the trunk of a tree behind
the house some weeks ago and he went off to see
if it was still there. When he got to the tree he
stood up on his hind-legs and looked into the hole.
A wasp flew out and stung him on the nose. He
sat down on the grass and watched the tree for a
minute and saw many wasps coming in and going
out through the hole. Then he understood what
had happened. Thousands of wasps had made a
nest in the hollow tree.</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_079.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">They set upon him and stung him</p>


<p>So he thought of a plan. He went and got a
big stick and threw it into the hole in the tree.
Then all the wasps came flying out and tried to
sting him. He went running towards the house
with the wasps after him and ran in through the
back door of the house. The wasps kept following
him&mdash;though a few stopped to sting some of the cats
that were hanging about the back door. Then he ran
up the stairs by the front staircase, into the bedrooms
and down by the back-stairs. In the hall he
found Beefsteak-and-Onions, who had just come in
from digging potatoes, with a spade in his hand. Punk
ran between his legs and out through the front door.</p>


<p>When the wasps could not find Punk any more
they thought the man had hidden him somewhere
so they set upon him and stung him. And the
rest of them stung all the cats they could find in
the house and drove them away across the fields.</p>

<p>Poor Beefsteak-and-Onions ran out into the yard
and shut himself up in the barn to get away from
the wasps. Then he laid down his spade and put
on his coat and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave this house today. My uncle can come
and live here himself if he wants to. But I&#8217;m going
back to London Town. I didn&#8217;t want to turn the
old lady out anyway. I do not believe my uncle
knew anyone was living here at all. I am going
today.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_085.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent"><b>&#8220;<i>Hooray, Hooray!</i></b></div>

<div class="indent"><b><i>Is going today.</i>&#8221;</b></div>
</div></div>


<p>Punk was listening outside the door and heard
him, so he ran off at once back to the woods. When
he got to Ponk and Pink he started dancing on his
hind-legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Ponk. &#8220;Have you
gone crazy?&#8221;</p>

<p>But all he answered was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;Hooray, Hooray!</div>

</div></div>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_089.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">They all walked back to the farm by moonlight</p>


<p>Then he told them how he had at last succeeded
and they both thought he was a very clever dog.</p>

<p>It was now getting late in the evening so they
went and got Mrs. Tubbs and they all walked back
to the farm by moonlight.</p>

<p>And the old woman was so happy to get back to
her little house that she made them all a very fine
supper. And Pink said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to get back. There is something to
eat here.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">They used to sit round the warm fire</p>

<p>And so when the leaves were all fallen in the woods,
and the trees stood bare waiting for the snow, they
used to sit round the warm fire in the evenings
toasting chestnuts and telling stories while the kettle
steamed upon the hob and the wind howled in the
chimney above. And they never had to leave the
farm again and they all lived happily ever after.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

approach us with offers to donate.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
