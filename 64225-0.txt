_The Story of_ MRS. TUBBS


Once upon a time, many, many years ago, there lived a very old woman
and her name was Mrs. Tubbs. She lived on a little farm, way off in
the country. Her little house stood on the edge of the woods, not
very far from a village with a little church, and a little river with
a little bridge over it, flowed close by the house. There was a barn
too for cows and horses, only the woman hadn’t any cows or horses; she
lived all alone with a dog and a duck and a pig. The dog’s name was
Peter Punk, the duck’s name was Polly Ponk, and the pig’s name was
Patrick Pink. The old woman called them Punk, Ponk and Pink for short.

[Illustration: Mrs. Tubbs’s Farm]

Punk and Ponk had known one another for many years and were very good
friends. The pig they treated as a baby because they said he was very
young and hadn’t much sense.

The old woman did not own the farm although she had lived on it so
long. The farm belonged to a man up in London who never came there at
all. This man, one fine day at the end of summer when the leaves were
beginning to fall in the woods, sent his nephew, a very silly young man
with a red face, down from London to live in the farm-house instead
of Mrs. Tubbs.

Punk, Ponk and Pink and the old woman were all dreadfully sad at having
to leave the home where they had been so happy together for so many
years.

As the sun was going down behind the little church one evening at the
end of Summer when the leaves were beginning to fall in the woods, they
all left the farm together, Punk in front, then Pink, then Ponk and
Mrs. Tubbs behind.

They walked a long, long way along the edge of the woods and at last
when they saw a seat under a tree they all sat down to rest.

[Illustration: They all sat down to rest]

“Oh dear, oh dear,” Mrs. Tubbs kept saying, “now I have no home, no
place to sleep. And me an old woman. To be turned off the farm after
all these years! What shall I do, where shall I go? Oh dear, oh dear!”

Then she stopped talking. Peter Punk and Polly Ponk both understood
what she said because they had lived with her so long. Pink couldn’t
understand because he was only a baby and he kept saying in animal
language:--“Let’s go on. I don’t like this place. There’s nothing to
eat here.”

“I do think it’s a shame,” Polly Ponk said to Punk, “that the old
woman should be turned out. Did you see the way that stupid man
slammed the door after we had gone? I’d like to see him turn _me_ out
of _my_ house that way. I’d give him such a peck on his red nose he
wouldn’t try it again! But of course she is old, very old. I often
wonder how old she really is.”

“She is over a hundred, I know,” said Punk. “Yes, it is a shame she
should have to go for that stupid booby. ‘Beefsteak-and-Onions’ I call
him. But it isn’t altogether his fault. He’s only sent here from London
by his uncle who owns the farm.”

“Well, what are we going to do with the old lady?” asked Ponk. “She
can’t stay here.”

[Illustration: They set Pink to digging truffles]

“We will wait till she falls asleep,” said Punk. “Then we’ll go into
the woods and find a cave for her to spend the night in and cook
something to eat.”

“Isn’t she asleep now?” asked Ponk. “Her eyes are shut.”

“No,” said the dog, “she’s crying. Can’t you feel the seat shaking? She
always shuts her eyes and shakes when she cries.”

Presently the old lady and the pig began to snore together. So they
waked poor Pink up and all three went into the woods. They set Pink
digging truffles and Polly Ponk went off to the river and caught a
fine trout while Punk got sticks together and made a fire.

“Now who’s going to do the cooking?” asked Punk.

“Oh, I’ll do that,” said Ponk.

“Can you cook?” asked the dog.

“Indeed I can,” said Polly Punk. “My Aunt Deborah used to cook at a
hotel and she showed me how. You get the fire burning and I’ll soon
have the fish fried.”

So very soon they had a nice meal ready of fried trout and truffles for
the old lady.

“Now,” said Punk, “we must go into the cave and get a bed ready for
Mrs. Tubbs.”

So they went into the cave and made a fine, soft bed of leaves.

“What shall we do for a pillow,” asked Punk. “Shall we use the pig, he
would be nice and soft?”

“No,” said Ponk, “I’m going to use him as a hot-water bottle. It’s very
important to keep the old lady’s feet warm. But I have some feathers
back home which will make a fine pillow. They are some of my own which
I kept last moulting season.”

“What did you do that for?” asked Punk.

“Well,” said the duck, standing first on one foot then on the other,
“the fact is I’m not getting any younger myself and I thought that if,
when I am very old, I should get bald, I could have them stuck on with
glue or something. I’ll fly over to the farm and fetch them. I know
just where I put them: they’re in the left-hand drawer of my bureau
under my lavender bonnet.”

With a flap of her wings she flew over the tree-tops to the farm and in
a minute was back again with the feathers in a bag.

When they had everything ready they went and fetched Mrs. Tubbs and
showed her the supper they had prepared. But the old woman would not
eat anything but kept saying,

“Oh dear, oh dear! What shall I do? I am turned out of house and
home, and me an old woman!”

[Illustration: She cried herself to sleep]

So they put her to bed in the cave, covered her over with leaves and
placed Pink at her feet as a hot-water bottle. And presently she cried
herself to sleep.

Punk and Ponk now began to worry over what they should do with the old
woman next.

“She can’t stay here,” said Ponk. “That’s certain. You see, Punk, she
isn’t eating anything. She is so upset and she is so old. What we’ve
got to do is to find some way to turn that booby out of the farm so she
can go back and live there.”

“Well, what shall we do?” said the dog.

“I don’t just know yet,” Polly Ponk answered.

[Illustration: _TOMMY SQUEAK_

_The King of The Water-Rats._]

“But in the morning before she wakes up, we must go back to the farm
and see what can be done.”

So next morning, while the old woman was still asleep, off they all
went as the sun was getting up behind the woods. Just before they got
to the farm as they were crossing the bridge over the stream, they saw
Tommy Squeak, the King of the Water-rats coming down for his morning
bath in the river.

“Catch him!” said Ponk. “Perhaps he’ll be able to help.” And they all
started running as hard as they could after the water-rat. Poor Tommy
Squeak was dreadfully frightened at seeing a dog and a pig and a duck
coming after him, and he made off for the river as fast as his legs
would carry him. When he came to the river he jumped in with a splash
and disappeared. Punk and Pink sat down on the grass and said,

[Illustration: They all started running as hard as they could]

“We’ve lost him!”

But Polly Ponk, running up behind, never stopped but dived into the
river, swam under the water and just caught poor Mr. Squeak as he was
popping into a hole way down at the bottom of the river. She pulled him
up by his tail, carried him to the shore and put him on the grass. Then
they all gathered round him so he couldn’t run away.

“Now,” said the duck, “don’t be frightened. Stay where you are and
do as you are told and we won’t hurt you. Listen. Do you remember, last
summer, when you were stealing cheese from the pantry up at the farm,
and you fell into a bucket of water and Mrs. Tubbs came and caught you?
Do you remember?”

[Illustration: _They all gathered round so he couldn’t run away._]

“Yes,” said Tommy Squeak, shaking the water off his whiskers, still
very frightened.

“And she didn’t hurt you or give you to the cat. Do you remember?”

“Yes,” said Tommy Squeak.

“She let you go and told you never to come back again. Did she not?”

“Yes,” said Tommy Squeak.

“You know that she is the kindest woman to animals in all the world,
don’t you?”

“Yes,” said Tommy Squeak.

“Allright,” said Polly. “Now listen. A red-faced booby from London
Town has been sent down here to turn Mrs. Tubbs out of her house. She
is terribly old, as you know; we have taken her up into the woods.
But she won’t eat her food, she is so sad, and we can’t do a thing
with her. The Winter is coming on and we must get her back into the
farm somehow. Now you are the king of the water-rats and this is what
you must do: Call all the rats of the river together--every one of
them--thousands of them, and take them to the farm. Then worry the
booby every way you can think of. Rattle the pans in the kitchen at
night so he can’t sleep. Pull the stuffing out of the chairs. Eat holes
in his best hat. Do everything you can to drive him out. Then, if he
goes back to London Town, we can put Mrs. Tubbs back on the farm.”

“Allright,” said Tommy Squeak. “I’ll do my best for the old woman. She
certainly ought to be put back on the farm.”

Then he stood up on his hind-legs by the river-bank and facing up the
stream, he gave a long, loud, wonderful squeak. Then he turned and
facing down the stream he gave another.

[Illustration: “Rats,” he said, “we have a job of work to do”]

And presently there was a rustling sound in the grasses all around and
a whispering sound in the bushes and a splashing sound from the water.
And everywhere rats appeared, hopping and jumping towards him--big
ones and little ones, black ones, grey ones, brown ones, piebald
ones--families of them, hundreds of them--thousands--millions. And they
gathered round Tommy Squeak the King-Rat in a great, great big circle.
Their beady, black eyes looked very frightened when they saw a dog
there but they didn’t run away because the king had called them.

Then Tommy Squeak stood up to speak to them and they all stopped
cleaning their whiskers to listen.

“Rats,” he said, “we have a job of work to do. Follow me.” And waving
his paw to Punk, Ponk and Pink, he led the way to the farm.

For a whole day and a night the rats worked very hard, trying to turn
the man out. They rattled the pans in the kitchen at night. They pulled
the stuffing out of his chair. They ate holes in his new, green hat.
They stopped the clock. They pulled the curtains down upon the floor.
But the man sent to London Town and got three wagon-loads of cats and
the rats were all driven back to the river. Tommy Squeak came to
Punk, Pink and Ponk on the second day and said,

“I am sorry. We did our best, but we couldn’t move him.”

[Illustration: _Tilly Twitter_

_The Queen of the Swallows_]

So Ponk said to Punk, “Well, we must try something else.” And they left
the old woman in the woods and started off again.

As they were crossing the river this time before they got to the farm,
they saw Tilly Twitter, the Queen of the Swallows, sitting on the
corner of the bridge.

“Good-morning!” said Tilly. “You all look very sad.”

“Oh, Tilly,” said Punk, with tears in his eyes, “Mrs. Tubbs has been
turned out of house and home.”

“Good gracious!” cried Tilly. “You don’t say! Who turned her out?”

“A man from London,” said Punk. “I call him ‘Beefsteak-and-Onions.’ Do
you think you can do anything to help us get her back to the farm?”

“Certainly I’ll do my best,” said Tilly, pushing her crown further back
on her head. “I have built my nest over the old woman’s door for three
Springs now. I would hate to have her leave the farm for good. I’ll see
what I can do.”

Then she flew up into the air going round and round in circles. Higher
and higher she flew and all the time she sang a beautiful song at the
top of her voice.

And this is the song she sang:

  “_The leaves are falling in the woods.
  Go get your travelling rugs and hoods.
  The Summer’s gone; the snow’ll soon be here.
  It’s time to fly; but we’ll come back next year._”

Now every year when all the swallows heard Tilly Twitter sing this song
they knew it was time for them to get together to fly to Africa because
they don’t like the winter’s cold in England. So now when they heard
it they got their children together and snatching up their bags and
bundles, they all flew towards Mrs. Tubbs’s farm. So many of them came
that the sky grew dark and people thought the night was come. And the
farm-boys in the country around stopped their plough-horses and said,
“There go the swallows, getting ready to fly to Africa. The frost will
soon be here.”

For five hours they kept coming, more and more and more of them. They
gathered around Tilly, sitting on house, on the barn and the railings,
on the gates, on the bridge and on the stones. But never on the trees.
Swallows never sit on trees. So many of them came that the whole land
seemed covered with the blue of their wings and the white of their
breasts.

And when they had all arrived Tilly got up and spoke.

“Swallows,” she said, “many years ago, when I first built my mud
nest under the eaves of this farm, I had five children in my nest. They
were my first family and I was very proud of them. That was before I
became the Queen of the Swallows. And being a very inexperienced mother
I built the nest too small. When my children grew up there was not
proper room for them. Philip--a very strong child--was always twisting
and turning in the nest and one day he fell out. He bumped his nose
badly on the ground but it was not far to fall and he was not much
hurt. I was just going to fly down and try to pick him up when I saw a
large weasel coming across the farm-yard to get him. My feathers stood
up on the top of my head with fright. I flew to the farm-house window
and beat upon the glass with my wings. An old woman came out. When she
saw Philip on the ground and the weasel coming to get him she threw
her porridge-spoon at the weasel, picked Philip up and put him back in
my nest. That old woman’s name was Mrs. Tubbs. She has now been turned
out of her house and a very stupid red-faced man is living on the farm
in her place. We have got to do our best to turn him out and put Mrs.
Tubbs back in her house, the same as she put my child back in his nest.
So I have called you all together a week earlier than usual this year
for our long journey to Africa, and before we leave England we have
got to see what we can do. The first thing we’ll do is to stop up his
chimney so his fire won’t burn. Then put mud all over the windows so
the light will not come in. Bring all the straw from the barn and fill
his bed-room with it. Take his best neck-tie and drop it in the river.
And do everything you can to drive him out.”

So the swallows set to work and Punk, Ponk and Pink went back to the
old woman in the woods.

But after two days Tilly came to them and said,

“I am very sorry, but I have not succeeded. The cats have driven my
swallows away. He has a thousand cats in the place. What can one do?”

So Punk said to Ponk, “We must go out and try something else.”

But Polly Ponk answered,

“No, you go alone this time. The old woman is getting a cold and I must
stay and look after her.”

So Peter Punk went off with his tail dragging on the ground. He hung
about the farm and was very sad and wondered what he could do to
drive Beefsteak-and-Onions out of the house.

[Illustration: He looked into the hole]

Presently, feeling hungry, he remembered he had hidden a ham-bone in
the trunk of a tree behind the house some weeks ago and he went off to
see if it was still there. When he got to the tree he stood up on his
hind-legs and looked into the hole. A wasp flew out and stung him on
the nose. He sat down on the grass and watched the tree for a minute
and saw many wasps coming in and going out through the hole. Then he
understood what had happened. Thousands of wasps had made a nest in the
hollow tree.

[Illustration: They set upon him and stung him]

So he thought of a plan. He went and got a big stick and threw it into
the hole in the tree. Then all the wasps came flying out and tried to
sting him. He went running towards the house with the wasps after him
and ran in through the back door of the house. The wasps kept following
him--though a few stopped to sting some of the cats that were hanging
about the back door. Then he ran up the stairs by the front staircase,
into the bedrooms and down by the back-stairs. In the hall he found
Beefsteak-and-Onions, who had just come in from digging potatoes, with
a spade in his hand. Punk ran between his legs and out through the
front door.

When the wasps could not find Punk any more they thought the man had
hidden him somewhere so they set upon him and stung him. And the rest
of them stung all the cats they could find in the house and drove them
away across the fields.

Poor Beefsteak-and-Onions ran out into the yard and shut himself up in
the barn to get away from the wasps. Then he laid down his spade and
put on his coat and said,

“I’ll leave this house today. My uncle can come and live here himself
if he wants to. But I’m going back to London Town. I didn’t want to
turn the old lady out anyway. I do not believe my uncle knew anyone
was living here at all. I am going today.”

[Illustration:

    “_Hooray, Hooray!
  He’s going away,
  Old Beefsteak-and-Onions
    Is going today._”]

Punk was listening outside the door and heard him, so he ran off at
once back to the woods. When he got to Ponk and Pink he started dancing
on his hind-legs.

“What’s the matter?” asked Ponk. “Have you gone crazy?”

But all he answered was:

  “Hooray, Hooray!
  He’s going away,
  Old Beefsteak-and-Onions
  Is going today.”

[Illustration: They all walked back to the farm by moonlight]

Then he told them how he had at last succeeded and they both thought he
was a very clever dog.

It was now getting late in the evening so they went and got Mrs. Tubbs
and they all walked back to the farm by moonlight.

And the old woman was so happy to get back to her little house that she
made them all a very fine supper. And Pink said,

“I am glad to get back. There is something to eat here.”

[Illustration: They used to sit round the warm fire]

And so when the leaves were all fallen in the woods, and the trees
stood bare waiting for the snow, they used to sit round the warm fire
in the evenings toasting chestnuts and telling stories while the
kettle steamed upon the hob and the wind howled in the chimney above.
And they never had to leave the farm again and they all lived happily
ever after.

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
